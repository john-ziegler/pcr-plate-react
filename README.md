# pcr-plate-react

Web-based PCR Plate application built with React, React DnD, Touch backend, and Flux.

To begin:

`npm install`

To start the server:

`npm start`

**Acknowledgements** - This little project was inspired by the [React DnD tutorial](http://gaearon.github.io/react-dnd/docs-tutorial.html) and the base of this repo was cloned from [react-hot-boilerplate](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-boilerplate)  




*Disclaimer* - this is still a work in progress, stay tuned for more improvements, functionality, and clean-up. 

**Current Todos**:
* Add export functionality to generate file/pdf of the current view
* Drag Preview for the touch backend
* Ability to select and drag groups of cells
* Refactoring 

Also, the application references an API which will need to be changed for subsequent uses.
